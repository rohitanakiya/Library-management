First you have to initialize the user database and book database. For smooth functioning please add a librarian while initializing. Another assumption that has been made is that whenever a book is returned through the librarian the student pays the fine for that book. Note that issuing and returning books can only be done by the librarian. The project has been tried to be as user-friendly as possible.
